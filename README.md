# ctf-archive
CTF archive.

# What is this project?
This is a project for saving the CTF solution and binaries for those who missed the challenges and
who want to save sometime on the re-analysing the challenges.

# Why do we need this?
There are times that we want to do some review on passed events and challenges but find no
archives available. And sometimes we don't have the time to analyse the whole challenge but
only want to do some of it, and that is hard for now since there are few data available.

# How is this project different from those writeups?
No this project is not for writeups only, although we welcome to save writeups as well. This project
would prefer `idb`s, `exp`s, or some scripts during solving the project.

# How is this project organized?
See the file structure already given.

# How can I contribute?
