idb is a bit large to be uploaded and is totally not needed since there are only two functions
to be concerned.

# Two important functions
6E613C should be `mmio_read`
6E61F4 should be `mmio_write`

# Environment notes
To compile the poc, what I did is to install a kernel of the same version as the kernel provided,
and the header as well.

# POC
poc during solving is provided in `poc`.

# send script
To send the exploit to the remote server, send script is provided in `poc`.
